From Kaggle: 
'Your Best Entry 
You advanced 132 places on the leaderboard!
Your submission scored 0.72248, which is an improvement of your previous score of 0.69856. Great job!'
Tasks I've done this time:
- Split the train set into train and dev set into a ratio of 7:3.
- Remained using KNN as algorithm, [PClass, Age, Sex] as predictors
- Normalized Age variable for both train/dev/test set

About one month ago from today (22nd March, 2018) I sent the first titanic result to Kaggle. The score was 0.69856. There is room of improvement to the data science technique used in the project. Therefore, I started a Problem section inside titanic.ipynb and jotted down tasks I'm missing.
